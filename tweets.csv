1992535070108733627,https://x.com/LegionzGaming/status/1992535070108733627,"Am I supposed to feel bad that the people that are animating One Punch Man Season 3 AS THEIR JOB, are being criticized for doing a HORRIBLE job? Wtf is this pansy as pity party response? They're just trying to guilt trip people into feeling bad for them and ignoring the dogshit animation.

Guess what happens when you do a bad job in any profession? You get fired and replaced and in their case it should have happened a long time ago. Cry me a river. I hope they do disappear and never work on something that's this beloved ever again until they get their shit together and get better at their job. When fan's can animate IN A FEW DAYS after an episode has aired something that looks 100 times better than these so called ""professional"" animators, then there is a massive problem.

I don't feel bad one fucking bit, they should be bullied out of working on this and quit and be replaced and they should remake this entire season. And before anyone comes at me saying they don't deserve this much criticism or that their feelings are hurt, content creators get sent death threats and told to kill themselves on a daily basis and I am one of them, not too mention any job that you do bad is going to be criticized. They are not special and should not be treated like little babies. MAN UP AND ADMIT THAT IT'S DOGSHIT AND YOU SUCK.",1991,210,193,90,283117,Sun Nov 23 10:05:54 +0000 2025
